 * The lite variant is the SAME agent with one hard rule removed: "name the exact documented rule
 * identifier per finding". So it is graded on the strict variant's exact tasks (same prompts, same
 * fixtures) MINUS the citation practices — which lite is designed not to satisfy. Asserting them
 * would contradict the artifact under test (a model without the citation instruction fails them by
 * design), not measure a defect.
 *
 * Everything else stays: both variants must still FIND the violations, quote them verbatim, assign
 * severity, and end with a gate verdict. What moves between the two runs is only the citation, which
 * is exactly the A/B this pair exists to expose — run `pnpm eval:delta` on the two labeled repeats.
